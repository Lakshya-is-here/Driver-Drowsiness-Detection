Driver drowsiness detection is an automobile safety feature that detects when the driver is becoming drowsy and avoids accidents. According to many studies, driver weariness is a key component in a huge number of vehicle accidents, accounting for roughly 20% of all road accidents and up to 50% on particular highways. According to recent figures, fatigue-related collisions result in 1,200 deaths and 76,000 injuries per year.
